        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            Describe the changes you made to the website using the browser's developer tools. Some potential questions
            to consider:
        <ul>
            <li>What text did you edit?</li>
			<p>I edited the prices to all be set to $0, and the banner to announce everything is now free.</p>
            <li>What CSS properties did you modify?</li>
			<p>I altered the font to be papyrus and the main banner to be red and italic.</p>
            <li>What made your edits interesting or amusing?</li>
			<p>An online store where everything is now free is amusing and silly.</p>
            <li>Did you understand why some changes worked and some didn't?</li>
			<p>Some edits I tried did not work and I had to find out where some elements were located in order to change them.<p>
            <li>Why did you choose the changes you did?</li>
			<p>I often like to browse Reverb to look at cool guitars, making the prices all $0 would be nice to happen.</p>
            <li>Were you able to understand how the HTML and CSS worked together to make the changes you made?</li>
			<p>Looking at the structure has allowed me to see how the HTML and CSS elements are linked together on the site.<p>
            <li>Do you think you have a better sense of how dev tools can be used while crafting your own webpages?</li>
			<p> Viewing the internals of a professionally built site has allowed me to better learn how to make my own site.<p?
        </ul>
