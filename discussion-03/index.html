			<h2>The Living Web</h2>
			<p>
				At the start of the course, the course portfolio felt like just another assignment. <br>
				But as I completed more lessons, it felt more personal. Like the essay said, the more I added to my personal website, the more personal it became. <br>
				Being able to revisit previous lessons on my own page, rather than a file explorer feels more personal. <br>
				Like putting books on a shelf instead of stacking them in the closet, having a dedicated site for myself feels more personal and individualistic.

			<h2>Part 2</h2>

				The purpose of the course portfolio is to give an insight to the owner of the site. <br>
				Allowing a user to see into the experiences that I have taken into following lessons of the course. <br>
				It doesn't just allow a user to look into my experiences, but also myself. <br>
				It allows me to look back into the lessons I have taken and learned and allow me to revisit them whenever I need to. <br>
				The purpose of the Professional Portfolio website will allow another user, or myself, to experience or re-experience the projects and courses I have completed.

				Hi Mia, I can understand your thoughts on reading the essay for the first time. <br>
				Not having much experience in the subject can prevent you from fully understanding the words of someone who is familiar with the topic. <br>
				Now that you know more about web customization, you have a new insight on how the author originally felt when revisiting the essay. <br>
				I also agree with your take on building a personal professional portfolio. <br>
				Being able to create a custom site made by you for others can allow another person to take a sneak peek into your personality and experiences. <br>
				And the portfolio can also serve as a benchmark for all your future projects.

				Hi Jose, I can also relate to your thoughts and feelings not changing much from the start of the course. <br>
				I put effort and personality into my work but I tend to not relate to the work as I feel they are just assignments to me. <br>
				The more I competed these courses though, I felt a stronger connection with my work. <br>
				Your thoughts on creating a personal portfolio are also similar, showing the start of my journey and the progression I have made have been documented in my personal portfolio.
