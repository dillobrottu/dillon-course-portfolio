			<h2>Student Introductions & The Purpose of a Personal Site</h2>
			<p>
				Hello, my name is Dillon Brown and I am originally from Killeen near the Fort Cavazos area (formerly Fort Hood) <br>
				but I currently live in Belton, Texas. I was previously learning at Central Texas College for a couple of years <br>
				where I took various different computer courses such as project management, cloud computing, and web design. <br>
				I am currently continuing my education at Texas Tech so I can finish my degree. <br>
				I am currently an amateur musician/artist who works in charting songs for other people and drawing pictures online for fun. <br>
				I attached an image of what my favorite guitar that I use looks like, this guitar means a lot to me as many of my favorite musicians that inspired me use this brand. <br>
				I have always worked with computers since I was little and taking these computer classes can hopefully allow me to get in to a field I enjoy.

				In the modern era, sites that allow for the creation of easy made media have become a dominant part of internet culture. <br>
				Though tools like social media, AI, and video sites are useful, creating a personal website for yourself can be better than the alternatives. <br>
				Making your own personal site allows for full customization and personalization of your page compared to the alternatives. <br>
				Other sites have a pre-made template for you to work in, while making your own site allows you to tailor make and personalize what ever you want for your site. <br> 
				Making a personal site is also more professional and allows you to show your skills as a web developer to anyone that visits it. <br>
				<br>
				The benefits of learning a markup language like HTML and CSS is that it allows you to understand how your site works. <br>
				Knowing what goes on underneath the hood of your site can allow you to make alterations and fixes to it fast and easy. <br> 
				Compared to using a template site or AI, using HTML allows you to work more personally with the site and allow you to work more in-depth compared <br>
				to the tools that the template sites can give you. And if something were to go wrong in the site, knowing HTML can allow you to fix it yourself instead of trying to rely on external methods.

				Hi Eishal, I hope you can enjoy yourself and your experience during this course. <br> 
				Being able to learn and further your education for your passions and interest can be a challenge but it will allow you to open new doors in life. <br>
				I agree with your stance on creating your own website, being able to express yourself using your own code and words can reflect who you are better than using premade templates or AI tools. <br>
				Learning markup languages like HTML and CSS can be ways of expressing your time and effort of experience and learning and displaying it through your own site.

				Hi Jarian, I also played the trombone in my high school's marching band, I hope you reach your personal goal of getting your dream car. <br>
				I agree with your stance on having a personal website. With all of the new tools like social medias and AI assistance, having a personal page premade for you is becoming more common. <br>
				Being able to create your own site to tell your own story and having it personalized can show yourself better than any premade templates can. <br>
				Learning a markup language like HTML and CSS can also assist you better than having a software or AI make it for you instead. <br> 
				I also feel like being able to create things yourself and show it to anyone across the planet is one of the things that makes the internet special, <br>
				and having things like AI do it for you really takes away the spirit of the internet.
