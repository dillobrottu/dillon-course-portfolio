                <p class="description">
                    Rockshow is a 1980 concert film of the North American tour of Paul McCartney and Wings.
					The film features live performances and songs that can be found on the Wings over America album and the Wings Over the World documentary.
					Rockshow is my favorite concert film as it shows the talent of McCartney and includes my favorite versions of each song performed.
					I always listen to the Rockshow version of each song as it to me sounds better and more raw compared to the studio album versions.
					Rockshow is in my opinion one of the best concert films.

                    Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii is a 1972 concert film of the performance by Pink Floyd at the Pompeii amphitheatre.
					Pink Floyd's performance is a strange story, as it is a concert with out an audience.
					Pink Floyd performance at the ancient roman amphitheatre is an experience for any person who watches and listens.
					Each composition is remade to fit only 4 people to perform which creates a more raw experience.
					Live at Pompeii is an experience and shows the talent of the Pink Floyd.

                    Exit... Stage Left is a 1982 concert film of the performance by Rush at the Montreal Forum.
					Exit... Stage Left features music from the album of the same name, but features some exclusive versions of some songs.
					The versions of each song are greater in quality to the studio versions in my opinion.
					The energy of each perfomance gives a feeling that can't be replicated.
					Exit... Stage Left is a great concert film and shows some of the best music performed by Rush.
