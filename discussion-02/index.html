			<h2>Deconstructing Web Design</h2>
			<p>
				Link to the website: https://reverb.com/Links to an external site. <br>
				<br>
				The website I have chosen for this discussion is Reverb, a online music retailer and marketplace. <br>
				Reverb uses the CSS Box Model across the entire site, utilizing it to show listings of instruments in rows and columns. On the home page, <br>
				it uses the flex box model to show a list of instruments for the user to view. <br>
				Each box is equally spaced out from each other and can flex itself to fit on any sized screen. <br> 
				The model can format itself to appear in different ways, in a horizontal rows, vertical rows, or a combined set of rows. <br>
				Each box shows an image, the title, the price, and quality of the listing, all equally spaced out from other listings. <br>
				Some listings are sized differently from others, to show a recommended or sponsored listing. <br>
				Reverb's use of the box model allows for the display of many different items that are being sold across the world.

				Hi Michael, as someone who frequents X (formerly Twitter) I can agree with your choice of website. <br>
				X (formerly Twitter)'s design utilizes a minimalistic style and has everything where a user can easily find what they are looking for. <br>
				As you said, the design is very user-friendly as it displays everything a user needs. <br>
				Everything is designed with care in mind, having the interface looking good while also being very functional. <br>
				Personally I use an extension that makes the layout even more minimized, I feel the interface is very well design and customizable as well.

				Hi Jarian, as someone who also likes music, I can agree with your choice of website. <br>
				Spotify's design allows for easy navigation for finding a song a user might want to listen to. <br>
				The design is user friendly and also aesthetically pleasing. <br>
				Equally spacing out the music from each other and giving a display of the music cover and artist allow for easy identification. <br>
				The iconic color choice and design differentiate it from its competitors. I can agree with your take on Spotify, though I personally prefer to use YouTube to listen to my music.
